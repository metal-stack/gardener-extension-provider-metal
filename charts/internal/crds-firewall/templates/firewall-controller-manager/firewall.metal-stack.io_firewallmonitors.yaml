                  FirewallDistance defines the as-path length of firewalls, influencing how strong they attract
                  network traffic for routing traffic in and out of the cluster.
                  This is of particular interest during rolling firewall updates, i.e. when there is
                  more than a single firewall running in front of the cluster.
                  During a rolling update, new firewalls start with a longer distance such that
                  traffic is only attracted by the existing firewalls ("firewall staging").
                  When the new firewall has connected successfully to the firewall monitor, the deployment
                  controller throws away the old firewalls and the new firewall takes over the routing.
                  The deployment controller will then shorten the distance of the new firewall.
                  This approach reduces service interruption of the external user traffic of the cluster
                  (for firewall-controller versions that support this feature).
